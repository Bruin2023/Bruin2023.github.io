        <h2><strong>Splinter and Bloom</strong></h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Kelly Kingman, and as part of my HTML/CSS project for IS 270, I decided to create a page about my creative work.  Splinter and Bloom is an offshoot of an exciting journey that I am on, exploring and developing techniques in mixed media and abstract art. My focus up to this point has been on the creation of collages using everything from paint to paper.</p> 
        
  

            
        <p>As I explored, I found myself drawn to vibrantly colored abstract art. Inspired by all the delicious colors and electric designs that I found by other artists on Instagram and the Internet, I decided to sign up for a course that will teach me how to create popping abstract art tucked into the pages of a my own sketchbook.

           <p>I am very excited to take Suzanne's <a href="https://www.artwithsuzanne.com/offers/F4sZnoL5/checkout" target="_blank"> 31 Bright and Fun Sketchbook Paintings</a> course! </p>
        <h2>How I used HTML & CSS to Create My Page</h2>
        <p>I had a lot of fun searching ChatGPT for different ways to alter and dress up my HTML page. I didn't get it exactly the way I wanted because of time, but I did change and add a few things. Here are just a few of the things I did:
        <p><strong>head:</strong> I split the page into two with a top header and a main content section.</p>
        <p><strong>section:</strong> I added a second image with a hyperlink to another website and I set the "background-color".</p>
        <p><strong>img:</strong> I added borders around images.</p>
        <p><strong>body:</strong> I set the "font-family" and "background-color".</p>
        <p><strong>a and a:hover:</strong> I changed the color, hover color, and added an underline to my hyperlink.</p>
        </p>
        <h2>Thanks for taking the time to check out my page!</h2></p>
