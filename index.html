            "explanation": "This supernova shock wave plows through interstellar space at over 500,000 kilometers per hour. Centered and moving upward in the sharply detailed color composite its thin, bright, braided filaments are actually long ripples in a cosmic sheet of glowing gas seen almost edge-on. Discovered in the 1840s by Sir John Herschel, the narrow-looking nebula is sometimes known as Herschel's Ray. Cataloged as NGC 2736, its pointed appearance suggests its modern popular name, the Pencil Nebula. The Pencil Nebula is about 800 light-years away. Nearly 5 light-years long it represents only a small part of the Vela supernova remnant though. The enormous Vela remnant itself is around 100 light-years in diameter, the expanding debris cloud of a star that was seen to explode about 11,000 years ago. Initially, the section of the shock wave seen as the Pencil nebula was moving at millions of kilometers per hour but has slowed considerably, sweeping up surrounding interstellar material.",

        <h2><strong>Splinter and Bloom</strong></h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Kelly Kingman, and as part of my HTML/CSS project for IS 270, I decided to create a page about my creative work.  Splinter and Bloom is an offshoot of an exciting journey that I am on, exploring and developing techniques in mixed media and abstract art. My focus up to this point has been on the creation of collages using everything from paint to paper.</p> 
        
  

            
        <p>As I explored, I found myself drawn to vibrantly colored abstract art. Inspired by all the delicious colors and electric designs that I found by other artists on Instagram and the Internet, I decided to sign up for a course that will teach me how to create popping abstract art tucked into the pages of a my own sketchbook.
            <p><a href="https://www.artwithsuzanne.com/offers/F4sZnoL5/checkout" target="_blank"><img src="T4SKSDXST4GI9Q6fIxWE_file.jpg" alt="31 Bright and Fun Sketchbook Paintings" width="300" height="auto" align="center"> </a> </p>
           <p>I am very excited to take Suzanne's <a href="https://www.artwithsuzanne.com/offers/F4sZnoL5/checkout" target="_blank"> 31 Bright and Fun Sketchbook Paintings</a> course! </p>
        <h2>How I used HTML & CSS to Create My Page</h2>
        <p>I had a lot of fun searching ChatGPT for different ways to alter and dress up my HTML page. I didn't get it exactly the way I wanted because of time, but I did change and add a few things. Here are just a few of the things I did:
        <p><strong>head:</strong> I split the page into two with a top header and a main content section.</p>
        <p><strong>section:</strong> I added a second image with a hyperlink to another website and I set the "background-color".</p>
        <p><strong>img:</strong> I added borders around images.</p>
        <p><strong>body:</strong> I set the "font-family" and "background-color".</p>
        <p><strong>a and a:hover:</strong> I changed the color, hover color, and added an underline to my hyperlink.</p>
        </p>
        <h2>Thanks for taking the time to check out my page!</h2></p>
